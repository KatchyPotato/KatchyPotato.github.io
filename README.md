# Website Sandbox
I am currently learning to code in HTML and CSS. This is my first website set up using Github pages, and will act as a sandbox for website development.

- Uses Github pages
- Uses index.html so Github knows the main file
- Comes with a custom URL that anyone can use
- [Link to Website](https://katchypotato.github.io/)

Pages is a great resource for anyone who wants to host a website but doesn't want to buy a domain.
